# Important notes

Each folder within `/routes` represents all of the pages and their sub-pages (children).

This is convention and file based routing is not enabled. All routing is done via the routing config __Link File__.

For example the route `/something` would map to the folder `~/routes/home/Route.tsx`

Use the Route.tsx convention to indicate the main export.
